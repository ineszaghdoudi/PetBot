  utter_pet_weight_advice:
  - text: "Determining if your pet is overweight can be challenging, but there are a few signs to look out for. For example, if you can't feel your pet's ribs when you run your hands along their sides, they may be carrying excess weight. Additionally, if your pet has trouble moving around or seems to tire easily, this may be a sign that they need to lose some weight."

  - text: "It's important to keep in mind that different breeds of animals may have different healthy weight ranges, so what's considered 'fat' for one animal may be normal for another. However, if you're concerned about your pet's weight, it's always a good idea to consult with your veterinarian. They can help you determine if your pet is at a healthy weight and provide advice on how to help your pet lose weight if necessary"
